# What this directory is for

New pages go here. Pages are routes within the application that get their own view.
For example if you want to add a view representing the detail of a user's post, you
will have a sub-directory like `posts/[id].tsx`.

# How to create a page

Create a `<page name>/[<parameter>].tsx` file with the React component
Create a `<page name>/[<parameter>].scss` file with the styles
Create a `<page name>/[<parameter>].test.ts` file with tests
