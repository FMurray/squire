Version 13 also introduces beta features like the app directory that works alongside the pages directory (stable) for incremental adoption. You can continue using pages in Next.js 13, but if you want to try the new app features, see the new beta docs.\\\\n\\\\nGetting Started\\\\nWelcome to the Next.js documentation!\\\\nIf you\\'re new to Next.js, we recommend starting with the learn course. The interactive course with quizzes will guide you through everything you need to know to use Next.js.\\\\nIf you have questions about anything related to Next.js, you\\'re always welcome to ask our community on GitHub Discussions.\\\\nSystem Requirements\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNode.js 14.6.0 or newer\\\\nMacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported\\\\n\\\\nAutomatic Setup\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe recommend creating a new Next.js app using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. (You don\\'t need to create an empty directory. create-next-app will make one for you.) To create a project, run:\\\\nnpx create-next-app@latest\\\\n# or\\\\nyarn create next-app\\\\n# or\\\\npnpm create next-app\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to start with a TypeScript project you can use the --typescript flag:\\\\nnpx create-next-app@latest --typescript\\\\n# or\\\\nyarn create next-app --typescript\\\\n# or\\\\npnpm create next-app --typescript\\\\n\\\\nAfter the installation is complete:\\\\n\\\\nRun npm run dev or yarn dev or pnpm dev to start the development server on http://localhost:3000\\\\nVisit http://localhost:3000 to view your application\\\\nEdit pages/index.js and see the updated result in your browser\\\\n\\\\nFor more information on how to use create-next-app, you can review the create-next-app documentation.\\\\nManual Setup\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInstall next, react and react-dom in your project:\\\\nnpm install next react react-dom\\\\n# or\\\\nyarn add next react react-dom\\\\n# or\\\\npnpm add next react react-dom\\\\n\\\\nOpen package.json and add the following scripts:\\\\n\\\\\"scripts\\\\\": {\\\\n  \\\\\"dev\\\\\": \\\\\"next dev\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"build\\\\\": \\\\\"next build\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"start\\\\\": \\\\\"next start\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"lint\\\\\": \\\\\"next lint\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nThese scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:\\\\n\\\\ndev - Runs next dev to start Next.js in development mode\\\\nbuild - Runs next build to build the application for production usage\\\\nstart - Runs next start to start a Next.js production server\\\\nlint - Runs next lint to set up Next.js\\' built-in ESLint configuration\\\\n\\\\nCreate two directories pages and public at the root of your application:\\\\n\\\\npages - Associated with a route based on their file name. For example, pages/about.js is mapped to /about\\\\npublic - Stores static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside public directory can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (/).\\\\n\\\\nNext.js is built around the concept of pages. A page is a React Component exported from a .js, .jsx, .ts, or .tsx file in the pages directory. You can even add dynamic route parameters with the filename.\\\\nInside the pages directory, add the index.js file to get started. This is the page that is rendered when the user visits the root of your application.\\\\nPopulate pages/index.js with the following contents:\\\\nfunction HomePage() {\\\\n  return <div>Welcome to Next.js!</div>\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nexport default HomePage\\\\n\\\\nAfter the set up is complete:\\\\n\\\\nRun npm run dev or yarn dev or pnpm dev to start the development server on http://localhost:3000\\\\nVisit http://localhost:3000 to view your application\\\\nEdit pages/index.js and see the updated result in your browser\\\\n\\\\nSo far, we get:\\\\n\\\\nAutomatic compilation and bundling\\\\nReact Fast Refresh\\\\nStatic generation and server-side rendering of pages/\\\\nStatic file serving through public/ which is mapped to the base URL (/)\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, any Next.js application is ready for production from the start. Read more in our Deployment documentation.\\\\nRelated\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFor more information on what to do next, we recommend the following sections:\\\\n\\\\nPagesLearn more about what pages are in Next.js.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCSS SupportBuilt-in CSS support to add custom styles to your app.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCLILearn more about the Next.js CLI.\\\\nBasic Features: PagesWas this helpful?EmailFeedbackSendEdit this page on GitHub\", \"metadata\": {\"source\": \"https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started\"}}'"
